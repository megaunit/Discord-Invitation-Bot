# Invitation bot

The native Discord "create invite link" permission allows the user to make as many links with as many capacity as they want. In private servers, this is not so desired. 
This bot aims to make this process more managable by:
- allowing specific users (by admin's choice) to create a 1-time-use links only
- notifing the admin each time a new link is created, enhancing monitored process.

Future work:
The bot could be expanded by logging notifications into a database, making it more suitable for bigger private servers. I didn't need this as privately notifing the admin works better for my small private server.
